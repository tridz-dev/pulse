# Pulse — Agent Reference

This is the canonical agent guide for the Pulse repository. Read it before
editing code or touching the Frappe bench. `CLAUDE.md` is the Claude-compatible
entry point and should stay aligned with this file.

Frappe app + React SPA that tracks SOP execution across a multi-branch organisation
and converts daily operational activity into measurable, hierarchical performance signals.

**Bench root:** `/workspace/benches`
**Reference bench:** `/workspace/benches/pulse-reference`
**Site:** `pulse-reference.local`
**App path:** `apps/pulse/`
**Frontend:** `apps/pulse/frontend/`

Bench commands run inside `frappe_docker_devcontainer-frappe-1`, using the
shared MariaDB (`mariadb`) and Redis services. Do not hand-roll bench
provisioning; use the installed `mh` scripts and the Pulse workspace manifest.
The reference bench is persistent and must not be torn down. Create disposable
feature benches through `mh new pulse-<name> --workspace pulse ...`.
The canonical executable is `/workspace/development/mh-tools/mh` with
`BENCH_ROOT=/workspace/benches`; `/workspace/development/mh-scripts` is only the
companion-script symlink.

Useful paths:

- Host repository: `/Users/safwan/Code/Experiments/Pulse/pulse`
- Host bench root: `/Users/safwan/Code/Docker/frappe_docker/benches`
- Container bench root: `/workspace/benches`
- Workspace manifest: `/workspace/benches/workspaces.json`
- Shared registry: `/workspace/benches/registry.json`
- Bench identity: `/workspace/benches/pulse-reference/BENCH_IDENTITY.md`

Typical commands:

```bash
docker exec frappe_docker_devcontainer-frappe-1 bash -lc \
  'cd /workspace/benches/pulse-reference && bench start'
docker exec frappe_docker_devcontainer-frappe-1 bash -lc \
  'BENCH_ROOT=/workspace/benches /workspace/development/mh-tools/mh list'
docker exec frappe_docker_devcontainer-frappe-1 bash -lc \
  'cd /workspace/benches/<assigned-feature-bench> && bench --site <assigned-feature-site> migrate'
```

The migration example is only for an assigned disposable feature bench. Never
substitute `pulse-reference` into it.

---

## Concept

The target behavior is defined by `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/PRODUCT_PLAN.md`, and
`docs/execution/06-domain-contracts.md`. Some sections below deliberately
describe the current prototype so agents can navigate it; item-level scoring,
recursive `combined_score`, and date-only locking are migration inputs, not the
target product contract.

Pulse closes the "accountability gap" between ground-level task execution and C-Suite KPIs.

```
Operator completes an SOP Run on time
        ↓
Generated run is classified Passed or Failed
        ↓
Supervisor sees run-weighted descendant compliance
        ↓
Area Manager sees the same explicit inherited scope
        ↓
Executive sees org-wide health
```

Every failed generated run reduces the explicit inherited score of managers in
its reporting line, while personal score remains separate.

## Current Prototype Scoring Logic (Legacy)

```
own_score = completed_items / total_items   (for period)

team_score = mean(combined_score of active direct reports with load)

combined_score:
  if team_score > 0 and own total_items > 0:  (own + team) / 2
  elif team_score > 0:                         team_score
  else:                                        own_score
```

This is what `pulse/api/scores.py` does today and is expected to be replaced by
the run-level compliance interface in the execution pack. Do not reproduce this
formula in new endpoints.

Score brackets used in insights distribution histogram:

| Bracket | Range |
|---|---|
| Exceptional | ≥ 90% |
| Strong | 80–89% |
| Moderate | 60–79% |
| At Risk | 40–59% |
| Critical | < 40% |

---

## Permission Model

Five Frappe roles (created at install):

| Frappe Role | Business Role | Visibility scope |
|---|---|---|
| Pulse User | Operator | Own SOP Runs only |
| Pulse Manager | Supervisor | Own + direct reports |
| Pulse Leader | Area Manager | Full subtree (recursive) |
| Pulse Executive | Executive | Entire organisation |
| Pulse Admin | Admin | Everything (same as Administrator) |

Row-level conditions are registered in `hooks.py → permission_query_conditions`:

```python
permission_query_conditions = {
    "SOP Run":          "pulse.api.permissions.sop_run_conditions",
    "Score Snapshot":   "pulse.api.permissions.score_snapshot_conditions",
    "Corrective Action":"pulse.api.permissions.corrective_action_conditions",
}
```

The condition functions (`permissions.py`) inject WHERE clauses into Frappe's list queries
based on the logged-in user's employee record and role.

## Scheduler Tasks

Registered in `hooks.py → scheduler_events`:

| Frequency | Function | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `daily` | `pulse.tasks.daily` | `generate_daily_runs()` + `lock_overdue_runs()` |
| `hourly` | `pulse.tasks.hourly` | `cache_score_snapshots()` — upsert today's Score Snapshot for all employees |
| `weekly` | `pulse.tasks.weekly` | `generate_weekly_runs()` — creates runs on Mondays only |
| `monthly` | `pulse.tasks.monthly` | `generate_monthly_runs()` — creates runs on the 1st only |

**generate_*_runs:** reads all active `SOP Assignment` records where the linked template
matches the frequency. For each assignment, creates one `SOP Run` if none exists yet for
that (template, employee, date) triple.

**lock_overdue_runs:** finds all `Open` runs with `period_date < today`, sets all `Pending`
items to `Missed`, sets run status to `Locked`.

**cache_score_snapshots:** calls `_calculate_score_snapshot()` for every active employee
and upserts the `Score Snapshot` DocType. Live calculation is still used for API calls
(snapshots are a read-optimisation for Insights SQL queries).

### Data flow

```
frappe-js-sdk (lib/frappe-sdk.ts)
    ↓
services/*.ts  →  pulse.api.*  (whitelisted Frappe methods)
    ↓
React pages / components
```

`AuthContext.tsx` wraps the app and calls `get_current_employee()` on mount.
Unauthenticated users are redirected to the Frappe login page.

## Install Flow

1. `bench get-app pulse <repo>`
2. `bench --site <site> install-app pulse`
3. `after_install` fires → creates 5 system roles, 4 Pulse Role records, 3 default departments
